# ferry-data-visualization

## Purpose:
Within this repository is contained the code that powers a student project that visualizes
The usage or lack of usage of masks on the ferry's in the city of Amsterdam, Specifically
focused on the ferries that arrive at Central Station.

## Data

The data that is being analyzed in this program, is that what we collected ourselves at the
ferry point. We did this by observing how many people were coming of the ferries, what their
mode of transportation was and whether or not they wore their required mask on departure of the 
ferry.

## Execution

We used coded animations applied on SVG illustrator files to stylize our project.Our code 
was written in Javascript.
